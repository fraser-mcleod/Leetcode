Problem Restatement:
- Given two sorted arrays with m and n entries of length m+n and n
- Sort the two sets of numbers such that they are all in the array of length m+n

Plan:
- Let A be the list of m+n size and B be the list of size n
- We should sort backwards, that way we do not need to worry about moving elements around
