Given a string s find the length of the longest substring withou repeating characters
Idea:
Keep two variables:
1. longest
2. Cur substring
We iterate through each character in the string adding it to cur. Once we encounter a repeat char, then
update longest and make cur = cur[j:] where j is the first occurance of the repeat variable
