Given a string s find the length of the longest substring withou repeating characters
Idea:
Keep two variables:
1. longest
2. Cur substring
We iterate through each character in the string adding it to cur. Once we encounter a repeat char, then
update longest and make cur = cur[j:] where j is the first occurance of the repeat variable.

Passed! Very fast and very good memory! Notes:
I think this would be charcaterized as a greedy algorithm. The data structure of char array
I think was much faster than String. Finally, illustrative test cases and comments were very useful.
