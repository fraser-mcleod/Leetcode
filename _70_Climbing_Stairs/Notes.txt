Problem Restatement:
 - You are climbing a staircase of height n
 - Each step, you can take one or two steps
 - How many unique ways are there to reach the top?
 - 1<=n<=45

Recursion Implementation:
 - Unique ways to add to n = 2 + unique ways to add to (n-1) + unique ways to add to (n-2)
 - Likely quite slow, but would be correct (Base cases n=0,1,2)
    - The more base cases, the fast it would be
 - Was fast actually (beats 100% of java users) and was easy Implementation of fibonacci seq
