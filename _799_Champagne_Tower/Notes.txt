Revisited November 2nd
Now, it is clear that this is a dynamic programming question.
As noticed before, the glass in the ith row and jth column only depends on the previous row.
However, we did not think to use a dynamic program before. This means we recalculated at EVERY recursive call
Instead, we will build up row by row.
We only need to store two rows at a time.
