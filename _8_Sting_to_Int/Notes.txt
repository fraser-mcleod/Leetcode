Given a string that may have leading whitespace, follwoing by '+' or '-', convert the string to an integer.
If the integer is too large or the integer is too small, 'clamp' at the max values.

We cannot go backwards as there may be other characters at end of string.
This means we must go forward.
How can we do this without allocating extra space?
Need to do two checks:
is MAX/10 < num
    return MAX
if num*10 > MAX-digit:
    return MAX
num = num*10
num=num+digit

similar case for negative

Complete! Notes:
 - Good to know Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE
 - Also good to review some of the odd ways to value of characters
 - Our submission was slow but good on memory. Ways to speed up:
    - Maybe less comparators? Maybe strip is slow?
